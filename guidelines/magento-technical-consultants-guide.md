## Overview
This document is designed to provide helpful information to assist the reader, a prospective Magento developer, in the acuisition of required skills. This is achieved by focusing the actual skills required as well as the learning material to use in the pursuit of the skills.

The target audience are prosepctive Magento who would like to know what to do next.

## Frontend v Backend
It is common practice for individuals to focus on specific areas of development, thus the terms frontend, backend and full-stack developer. Within the Consnet environment, it would not be a good to create that separation in your skills development as you will be required to work in all areas as long as it is technical work. 

The document still creates a separation between frontend and backend development, but only to allow fast-track or  correctly sequence the acquisition of the skills needed for both areas. The fast-tracking is necessary only when you have to acquire the requisite skills to achieve an assigned role as a frontend or backend developer.

## Prerequisite Skills
As with any other subject areas, there are skills or working knowledge you should have before you start working with Magento. 

As a developer, you are required to have knowlege of the following to the extent described therein. If you have all the pre-requisite knowledge, you are ready to start diving into full-stack development. For those wanting to specialise, items 1, 2 and 3 should suffice for backend development and items 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are essential for frontend developers. 

 **1. PHP**
	 An open-source, server-side (backend) scripting language designed mainly for web development. This is the programming language you will use most of the time. As far as versions go, it will be beneficial if you are familiar with PHP7. Familiarity with PHP at this point comes with an assumption that you are familiar with **Object Oriented Programming(OOP)** and the **Model-View-Controller(MVC)** paradigm. 
	 
It is required that you have or develop intermediate to advanced knowledge on this language to effective with Magento.

## Suggested Path 
The following is the suggested path:

1. Acquire Prerequisite Skills
	 If there is a prerequisite skill you are not familiar with, you should start there and the necessary knowledge to the level indicated
	  
2. Set Up a Local Instance
	You should set a local instance on your machine for practice and to familiarise yourself with Magento. You can start by using the **Configuration Guide for Installation of Magento 2.4 on local using XAMMP** guide. The expectation is that in the end, you should be able to set up a local instance on a Linux environment, following the necessary documentation.
	
3. Learn how Magento Works
	Before you start developing on the Magento platform, you should familiarise yourself with how Magento works. Using your local instance, go through the admin and know how to set up new products, shipping, catalog price rules, and shopping cart rules. Test the checkout process as a customer and know how it works from the front end. You can use the Magento official documentation to learn about more features and components of Magento.

4. Magento Courses 
	Go through the Magento Courses as given in the **Magento Resources** section above . These are found on the Adobe Solution Partner Program. If you are not enrolled yet, please use the  **Adobe Solution Partner Program - Registration and Course Enrollment** document to create your own account. 

5. Additional Resources
	You should use the Magento devdocs as the ultimate source of required information and also to learn about architecture, style guides and best practices.
