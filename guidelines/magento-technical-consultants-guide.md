# Magento Technical Consultants Onboarding
 
## Overview
 This document is meant to be a get-yourself-ready guide for new consultants involved in a Magento Open Source or Magento Commerce project. It is assumed that the reader is aware of what Magento is.

## Frontend v Backend
Depending on your role on a project, you might find yourself predominantly doing frontend or backend related work. However, you will be well advised not to focus your learning on one area as you will, at one point, be involved in both areas of work. Your skills development and learning path should assume involvement as a full-stack developer. 

With the above said, the document will provide information that is relevant for both areas and separate them as well so that you can quickly get to grips with a specific area if there are time constraints.

## Prerequisites
As with any other subject area, there are skills or working knowledge you should have before you start working with Magento. 

You should have working knowledge of familiarity with the following:

 1. PHP
	 An open-source, server-side (backend) scripting language designed mainly for web development. This is the programming language you will use most of the time. As far as versions go, it will be beneficial if you are familiar with PHP7. Familiarity with PHP at this point comes with an assumption that you are familiar with **Object Oriented Programming(OOP)** and the **Model-View-Controller(MVC)** paradigm.
