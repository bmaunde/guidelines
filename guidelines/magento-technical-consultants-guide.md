# Magento Technical Consultants Onboarding
 
## Overview
 This document is meant to be a get-yourself-ready guide for new consultants involved in a Magento Open Source or Magento Commerce project. It is assumed that the reader is aware of what Magento is.

## Frontend v Backend
Depending on your role on a project, you might find yourself predominantly doing frontend or backend related work. However, you will be well advised not to focus your learning on one area as you will, at one point, be involved in both areas of work. Your skills development and learning path should assume involvement as a full-stack developer.
