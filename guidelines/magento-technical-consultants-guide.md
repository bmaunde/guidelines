The target audience are prosepctive Magento who would like to know what to do next.

## Frontend v Backend
It is common practice for individuals to focus on specific areas of development, thus the terms frontend, backend and full-stack developer. Within the Consnet environment, it would not be a good to create that separation in your skills development as you will be required to work in all areas as long as it is technical work. 

The document still creates a separation between frontend and backend development, but only to allow fast-track or  correctly sequence the acquisition of the skills needed for both areas. The fast-tracking is necessary only when you have to acquire the requisite skills to achieve an assigned role as a frontend or backend developer.

## Prerequisite Skills
As with any other subject areas, there are skills or working knowledge you should have before you start working with Magento. 

As a developer, you are required to have knowlege of the following to the extent described therein. If you have all the pre-requisite knowledge, you are ready to start diving into full-stack development. For those wanting to specialise, items 1, 2 and 3 should suffice for backend development and items 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are essential for frontend developers. 

 **1. PHP**
	 An open-source, server-side (backend) scripting language designed mainly for web development. This is the programming language you will use most of the time.

Using your local instance, go through the admin and know how to set up new products, shipping, catalog price rules, and shopping cart rules. Test the checkout process as a customer and know how it works from the front end. You can use the Magento official documentation to learn about more features and components of Magento.
