# UX Design Guidelines and Best Practices

## Purpose
This document is aimed to provide some guidelines when designing the UX of your application. Although UI and UX are sometimes used interchangeably, it is important to know that these are two different aspects and we will be more focusing on the UX Design side of things.

## What is UX and UX Design?
We can describe __User Experience__ (UX) as the value that you provide to your customer or end user when he/she is using your product, and __User Experience Design__ is the process of development and improvement of quality interaction between a user and all facets of a company.

For a retail company for instance, an active or potential customer can interact with the company (and its products) via a physical medium (such as the shelvings in a retail stor) or a digital medium (such as a web or mobile App).

User Experience Design is in theory a non-digital (cognitive science) practice, but it is used and defined predominantly by digital industries. Thus, in this document, we will only focus on the application of UX Design when building digital mediums such as web or mobile application.

Developing a user experience to the level of customer satisfaction is not a single person or team’s responsibility, instead it should be a company’s vision.

## Difference between UI Design and UX Design
There are multiple articles and books going more in depth with the difference between User Interface (UI) design and User Experience (UX) design, but to keep this document short, while UX design focusses on developing and improving the overall experience that the user has when using your product, UI design only focusses on the looks and feel of the items that the user is interacting with.

To denote the contrast between UI and UX, allow me to quote Helga Moreno, who put it rather eloquently in her article __The Gap Between UX And UI Design__: *“Something that looks great but is difficult to use is exemplary of great UI and poor UX. While Something very usable that looks terrible is exemplary of great UX and poor UI.”*

Hence, it is safe to say that User Interface design is an important aspect and subset of User Experience design.

## Why User Experience Matters?

As mentioned in the sections above, this document will only be focusing on the application of User Experience (UX) Design in the digital industry and digital mediums such as mobile and web Applications.

What makes a great App is not just a great idea or the technology behind it, but also how it looks and how easy it is to use.

*__“Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.”*__ — Steve Jobs.

Great user experience design not only highlights and promotes your product, it has become a key part of building and growing customer confidence.
A great product or compelling content without an appealing user experience may affect the ability of an organization to achieve its business goals.

## Best Approach to User Experience Design

User Experience Design is a __human-first__ way of designing products and good User Experience Design is always part of product development process.

*“The primary factor of your success lies in the fact that you keep your user in center of your design process.”*

You interact with your users to build the unique combination of structure, content and user experience that will accomplish required goals in efficient ways.

This approach allows you to create designs that are __clean, simple, intuitive, flexible and engaging__, and provide a WOW experience to your users.

## User Experience Design Process

1. Understand

    A design is meant to solve a problem, and to solve a problem, you need to understand it first.

    __Stakeholders__
    - Design Team
    - Business Manager
    - Product Manager

    __Activities__
    - Meet, talk, observe and understand users in their environment
    - Analyze requirements to understand and clarify them
    - Define user personas and use-cases

    __Outcomes__
    - User Personas
    - User Stories
    - Use Cases, User Flows

2. Research
    
    This is a key step in the UX design process, the Design Team tries to see how the features in the solution they want to design are being implemented in the outer world and pinpoint areas that they need to improve on and those that they can get inspiration from.

    __Stakeholders__
    - Design Team

    __Activities__
    - Study of competitors’ approaches
    - Research on similar features in the world
    - Analysis of latest UI/UX trends, design principles and rules
    - Keep an eye on your own UX guidelines

    __Outcomes__
    - A bunch of ideas and material on which you can build your actual design work
    
3. Sketch
    
    This step involves some iterations of the UI Definition of required features. This can be in the form of paper sketches, white board flows and/or wireframes.

    __Stakeholders__
    - Design Team
    - Product Managers
    - Technical Experts

    __Activities__
    - Generate ideas and work on basic sketches
    - Brainstorming sessions with stakeholders to get their feedback from technical perspective
    - Re-draw sketches and re-test them with stakeholders

    __Outcomes__
    - Sketches
    - Wireframes, Mockups
    - User flows<!-- TODO: Elaborate here -->

2. Research

4. Design

    This is the step where you basically turn your initial mockups and wireframes to great-looking images or UI components with theme and styles applied to them. These components will form part of your design specifications (principles, guidelines, colors, typography, iconography) which will be shared with the Development team

    __Stakeholders__
    - Design Team
    - Product Managers
    - Business Manager
    - Technical Experts

    __Activities__
    - Design UI images
    - Define final theme, specs, and guidelines required for implementation
    - Design icons to display on screens
    - Sessions with stakeholders to get their feedback from business and technical perspective

    __Outcomes__
    - Design images
    - Detailed design specs like colors, theme, styles, guidelines
    - Icons<!-- TODO: Elaborate here -->
    
5. Implement

    In this step, the Development team builds the UI based on the design artifacts provided by the Design team.

    It is always a good idea to have the Development team involved in the early stages of the Design process so that they can start the  back end implementation while Design phase is in progress.

    __Stakeholders__
    - Development team
    - Design Team

    __Activities__
    - Implement back-end functionality and front-end interface

    __Outcomes__
    - Developed UI with complete functionality and experience following the designed theme and style
    
6. Evaluate
    
    The Design team validates the product in terms of user experience in order to identify areas where improvements are needed.

    The product can be evaluated based on the following factors:
    - Whether the system is usable?
    - Is it easy to use for end user?
    - Is it flexible and easy to change?
    - Does it provide the desired solution to user’s problems?
    - Does the product have the credibility that makes someone want to use it because of the experience it provides?

    __Stakeholders__
    - Design Team
    - Product Manager

    __Activities__
    - Go through the flow and feel the experience
    - Perform a comparison of implementation and defined interface

    __Outcomes__
    - User feedback
    - UI audit reports
    - Areas marked where improvement is required<!-- TODO: Elaborate here -->
    
6. Evaluate
