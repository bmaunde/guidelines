## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines that are helpful when designing REST based APIs or web services. 

## Why
There are, broadly, two styles for designing web based APIs - SOAP and REST. 
SOAP is not only a style, but also a protocol. It uses various protocols, including HTTP, for the transfer of data. 
REST is simply an architectural style for designing web based APIs that relies on the HTTP protocol for the transfer of data. It stands for Representation State Transfer.REST is more flexible, architecturally sound, scalable and web friendly than SOAP.  
When designing web APIs, it is advisable to first consider using REST and only resort to using SOAP when necessary. 

## Principles
Outlined below are different principles that should be considered and followed when designing REST APIs

### Understanding Key Elements
There are a few elements whose meaning is important and should be understood well in order to successfully design REST APIs. They are:
