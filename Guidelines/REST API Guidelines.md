# REST API Guidlines

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines that are helpful when designing REST based APIs or web services. 

## Why REST
Broadly, there are two architectural or design styles that are used when designing web based APIs. These are SOAP and REST. SOAP is a protocol that in turn uses other protocols for the transfer of data. REST on the other hand is merely an architectural style that depends on the HTTP protocol for transfer of data between systems.
